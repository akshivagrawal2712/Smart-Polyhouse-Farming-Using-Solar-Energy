# Smart-Polyhouse-Farming-Using-Solar-Energy  
*Farming under artificial environment such as temperature, moisture, PH is called Polyhouse Farming.  
*In this project,  with the help of sensors we are making this project fully automatic.  
*We are also using off grid solar panels to power this project so it is also power efficient.  
*Through Bluetooth module we will also control it with smartphone which is the application of IOT.
